/**
 * * Page keystring constants
 * Instead of having us all change the keystrings in App.js, it would be better
 * to have the changes all be centralized here.
 *
 * When you add a page to switch to, add a keystring constant here.
 * You can edit them at any time without worry of inconsistencies.
 *
 * We love constants!
