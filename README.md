# Moments by SVJ

#### Status: Under Construction

##### Moments by SVJ is a Happiness App. Cherish the good.

Remember that life can be great! Your office threw a surprise party. You achieved that milestone you worked so hard for. Your dog just learned to roll over. These nuggets of cheer can now be preserved and enjoyed!

We're a glass-half-full kind of team, and that's what Moments is all about. Getting through the troughs of our days by remembering the peaks. You can receive daily notes, each containing a favorite moment from your collection. Create new ones with pictures, videos, great quotes, voice recordings, social media posts, and more. Share moments with your closest friends and family, so they can relive it with you.

With Moments, you can also create new memories! Send handwritten notes to your closest friends, or buy a drink, snack, or small gift for your loved one through the Moments social platform. They'll appreciate the gesture, and so will we! Light points will be awarded for engaging with your friends and family, just to thank you for bringing a little light into their life.

## Getting Started

Moments is an app built on React Native, intended for release on both Google Play store and iOS App store. However, you can also contribute and/or test the app through this repo

### Prerequisites

Built upon Node.js - All systems [install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Mac Homebrew [install](https://changelog.com/posts/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x)

Install Expo CLI

### Installing

##### Build from Github

Clone this repository, then navigate to the repository and in your command line run:

```
npm start
```

This will begin running the app. A QR code should pop up either in the browser or in your command line (usually both).

For iOS: use your default Camera app to view the provided QR code, and a prompt should pop up to open the app in Expo Client. Tap it, and it should bring you to the Expo Client where the app should build automatically.

For Android: use the QR Code Reader in the Expo App to view the QR code, and the app should start building automatically.
